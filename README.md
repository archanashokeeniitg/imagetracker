Architecture Diagram


Introduction

Smart Image is an image gallery that stores your pictures in a cloud based application. With an AWS backend for storage in the cloud, your images can be instantaneously retrieved without any worries of image loss.  It provides features like disaster resistance, robustness, fully scalable application.




Technologies & Functionalities

Smart Image uses multiple new technologies to ensure that the users have better control and access to their images. From the architectural diagram above, the application is written in React and hosted on AWS Amplify using graphql. The schema has templates for the image object and its information which are stored in both AWS S3 bucket and DynamoDB respectively.

Authentication is essential and a core area of our application development. AWS Cognito provides authentication using username and password, in addition to email and SMS notifications for registration so that only authorized users can access their application. Images uploaded to the bucket are segregated by username using IAM users.Services like download and delete is provided in the application so that images can also be downloaded locally or deleted from the S3 bucket.

Smart Labeling using Amazon Rekognition is implemented as the functionality of the project. Since we aim to build a platform like Google Photos for image storage, the labels will be used to search and sort the images. The labels will be linked to the react app using graphql and will be stored in the DynamoDB database. Thus, when a user uploads an image, they can also add labels which can be used to identify similar images in the gallery, which are improved in retrieval performance using  Cloudfront CDN, built into Amplify and Route53.

Finally, the application is hosted on Amplify which is complemented by Route53 for custom domain, so that anyone with the URL can access the application.

During the development process, code was hosted on GitHub for CI/CD purposes with regular commits. In the beginning, we cloned from a central repository branch and developed our components, and then merged them back into a central repository branch which we hosted on AWS Amplify.
